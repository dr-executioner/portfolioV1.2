      "Built a cross-platform system health tracking solution designed for Turborepo workspaces. The platform consists of a React-based dashboard for monitoring real-time health metrics across all users. On the backend, a Golang service (functioning as a backend-for-frontend, or BFF) aggregates and manages user data. Users install a lightweight Golang application (cross-compiled for Windows, Mac, Linux) that runs as a background service. This app periodically gathers key system health information‚Äîsuch as CPU, memory, and uptime‚Äîand securely transmits updates every 5‚Äì10 seconds to the backend server. Incoming data is processed instantly and reflected on the dashboard, ensuring administrators always have an up-to-date view of their team's system health. This architecture enables robust, responsive monitoring for distributed teams, combining efficient Go services with a modern web frontend for actionable insights",
